# Finance Calculator

The Finance Calculator is a Python-based tool designed to help users make quick and informed financial decisions. It offers two main functionalities: calculating the future value of an investment and determining the monthly repayments for a home loan (bond). This simple, interactive script is user-friendly and requires minimal financial knowledge to use.

## Features

- **Investment Calculator:** Calculate the total amount you'll have after a certain period of investing a specific amount of money at a given interest rate. It supports both simple and compound interest calculations.
- **Bond Calculator:** Determine your monthly repayment amount for a home loan based on the loan's principal amount, the interest rate, and the loan term in months.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. This script has been tested with Python 3.8, but it should be compatible with most Python 3 versions. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/md-khan02/finance-calculators

Navigate to the cloned directory:
cd finance-calculator

# Usage
Run the script using Python:
python finance_calculator.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to select the calculation type (investment or bond) and enter the required information.

# How It Works
Investment Calculation: Based on the principle of interest calculation, the script computes the future value of an investment, taking into account the initial deposit, interest rate, duration, and the nature of the interest (simple or compound).
Bond Calculation: The monthly repayment amount for a bond is calculated using the formula for an annuity, considering the loan amount, annual interest rate, and repayment period.
